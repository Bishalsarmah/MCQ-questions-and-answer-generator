# MCQ Questions and Answers Generator

## Overview

The MCQ Questions and Answers Generator is an advanced tool designed to automate the creation of high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from any given text. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this system extracts relevant keywords and generates challenging, contextually accurate questions and plausible distractors. This project aims to save time for educators while ensuring consistency and accuracy in assessment materials.

## Features

- *Automated Keyword Extraction*: Uses Python Keyphrase Extraction (PKE) to identify the most important keywords from the text.
- *Sentence Tokenization*: Splits the text into sentences and selects those suitable for question generation.
- *Sense Disambiguation*: Determines the correct sense of each keyword to ensure contextual accuracy.
- *Distractor Generation*: Utilizes WordNet and ConceptNet to create plausible distractors that match the sense of the keywords.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload text files and specify the number of MCQs to generate.
- *Customizable Output*: Generates MCQs tailored to the input text, providing educators with high-quality assessment tools.

## Future Enhancements

- *Advanced NLP Techniques*: Incorporating models like BERT and GPT for improved accuracy in keyword extraction and sense disambiguation.
- *Deeper Contextual Analysis*: Ensuring that distractors are more closely aligned with the intended meaning of the keywords.
- *User Feedback Mechanism*: Adding features for users to rate the quality of the generated MCQs to refine the algorithm over time.
- *Multilingual Support*: Expanding the system to support multiple languages, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- *Additional Question Types*: Exploring the generation of True/False questions to diversify assessment materials.
- *Enhanced Input Flexibility*: Supporting various input formats such as PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, images, and webpage links.
